Login or Regisery Security issues? Follow my Method.

First in your project create , IUser interface, ClsUser Class, and Xss class for more security issues.<br>
then use'em in login.cs page.<br>
Also I create and use a session class, "clsSession.cs" to use multiple sessions across the app.

Goodluck :)
